# Tensorflow implementation for George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2025

This is our implementation 
#### CODE-15% dataset

These instructions use `code15_input` as the path for the input data files and `code15_output` for the output data files, but you can replace them with the absolute or relative paths for the files on your machine.

1. Download and unzip one or more of the `exam_part` files and the `exams.csv` file in the [CODE-15% dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/4916206).

2. Download and unzip the Chagas labels, i.e., the [`code15_chagas_labels.csv`](https://physionetchallenges.org/2025/data/code15_chagas_labels.zip) file.

3. Convert the CODE-15% dataset to WFDB format, with the available demographics information and Chagas labels in the WFDB header file, by running
        python prepare_code15_data.py \
            -i code15_input/exams_part0.hdf5 code15_input/exams_part1.hdf5 \
            -d code15_input/exams.csv \
            -l code15_input/code15_chagas_labels.csv \
            -o code15_output/exams_part0 code15_output/exams_part1

Each `exam_part` file in the [CODE-15% dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/4916206) contains approximately 20,000 ECG recordings. You can include more or fewer of these files to increase or decrease the number of ECG recordings, respectively. You may want to start with fewer ECG recordings to debug your code.
